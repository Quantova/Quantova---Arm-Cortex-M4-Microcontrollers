Below are the Findings 

Key Areas Explored & Findings
1Ô∏è. Benchmarking Framework Analysis
    ‚Ä¢ The pqm4 library includes a benchmarking toolset that measures speed, memory consumption, and code size for various post-quantum algorithms.
    ‚Ä¢ These benchmarks are crucial for evaluating the feasibility of post-quantum cryptography on embedded platforms.
    ‚Ä¢ The results help in comparing different PQC algorithms, allowing developers to select the best cryptographic primitives based on their hardware constraints.
    ‚Ä¢ Key metrics analyzed:
        ‚ó¶ Execution time (in clock cycles).
        ‚ó¶ RAM & Flash memory consumption.
        ‚ó¶ Key generation, encryption, and decryption performance.
 Findings:
    ‚Ä¢ PQC algorithms have higher computational costs than traditional ECC/RSA cryptography.
    ‚Ä¢ Lattice-based cryptographic schemes (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium) offer a good balance between security and efficiency.
    ‚Ä¢ Hash-based signature schemes (e.g., SPHINCS+) provide high security but at the cost of slower verification times and larger signature sizes.

2Ô∏è. Integration of PQClean Implementations
    ‚Ä¢ pqm4 integrates cryptographic implementations from the PQClean project.
    ‚Ä¢ PQClean provides NIST PQC Standardization candidates with a focus on portability and security.
    ‚Ä¢ This integration ensures that the cryptographic implementations follow standardized practices and are vetted by the cryptographic community.
  Findings:
    ‚Ä¢ PQClean ensures that pqm4 adheres to best practices in post-quantum cryptography.
    ‚Ä¢ The modular design makes it easy to swap and compare different PQC algorithms.
    ‚Ä¢ Not all PQC algorithms are optimized for embedded platforms, and some require additional optimizations to improve performance.

3Ô∏è. Post-Quantum Algorithms Tested on ARM Cortex-M4
I focused on two primary classes of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms implemented in pqm4:
	Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs): Used for secure key exchange.
    ‚Ä¢ Kyber (Lattice-based)
    ‚Ä¢ NTRU (Lattice-based)
    ‚Ä¢ FrodoKEM (Lattice-based)
  Digital Signature Schemes: Used for authentication and integrity verification.
    ‚Ä¢ Dilithium (Lattice-based)
    ‚Ä¢ SPHINCS+ (Hash-based)
    ‚Ä¢ Falcon (Lattice-based)
  Findings:
    ‚Ä¢ Kyber and Dilithium (both lattice-based) performed relatively well in terms of execution time and memory footprint.
    ‚Ä¢ SPHINCS+ had larger signature sizes and slower verification times, making it less suitable for constrained environments.
    ‚Ä¢ Falcon provided compact signatures but had higher complexity in key generation.
    ‚Ä¢ Hybrid cryptography (Classic + PQC) is feasible for transitioning to post-quantum security while maintaining compatibility with classical cryptographic systems.

4Ô∏è.  Performance & Optimization Strategies for Cortex-M4
    ‚Ä¢ The pqm4 library optimizes finite field arithmetic and modular multiplication to enhance the efficiency of post-quantum algorithms.
    ‚Ä¢ It uses assembly-level optimizations and ARM Cortex-M4 DSP instructions for certain operations.
    ‚Ä¢ Key focus areas for optimization:
        ‚ó¶ Reducing stack and RAM usage for better memory efficiency.
        ‚ó¶ Optimizing polynomial arithmetic for lattice-based schemes (Kyber, Dilithium).
        ‚ó¶ Parallelizing operations where possible to speed up execution.
üìå Findings:
    ‚Ä¢ ARM Cortex-M4's limited RAM and Flash storage require careful algorithm selection.
    ‚Ä¢ Kyber and Dilithium provide a good tradeoff between speed and security, making them suitable candidates for PQC on embedded systems.
    ‚Ä¢ Further optimization at the assembly level could improve efficiency, particularly for lattice-based cryptographic schemes.
Conclusion
The mupq/pqm4 library is a powerful tool for implementing and benchmarking post-quantum cryptography on embedded devices. Through benchmarking, testing, and integration with PQClean, it provides insights into which PQC algorithms are most suitable for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. The next steps involve porting, optimizing, and contributing to the project while continuing research on hybrid cryptographic models and attack resistance strategies.
